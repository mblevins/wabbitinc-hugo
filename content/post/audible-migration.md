Downloaded [book lib connect](https://github.com/audiamus/BookLibConnect), followed instructions to enter amazon credentials, and downloaded audio books. Note: this will use an amazon browser session to scrape an access token, so it seems reasonably safe from a password point of view. Audio books are in d:\audible_downloads, aax exports in d:\audible_downloads\audible_exports

Downloaded [aax audio converter](https://github.com/audiamus/AaxAudioConverter)
