Lola and Mike have retired from the Wabbit Wangling business, this site now has trip and event reports, and the occasional "how-to" notes.

There are no incorporated Wabbits here. 

If you're looking for the old Silver Fiddle Ranch web site, it is archived [here]({{< relref "sfr/home" >}})

If you're looking for the old lolablevins web site, Lola is retired and no longer accepting clients. 

If you're at our house, these are some links that only work on the house network:
