Silver Fiddle Ranch FAQ

The old name of Shake Ridge Rd was the "Silver Lake Fiddletown Road", so "Silver Fiddle Ranch"

_Are there equestrian trails?_

There are [trails on the property]({{< relref "/sfr/trail-access" >}}), and they connect to the SPI timber company which has miles of trails, SPI has a [written statement allowing recreation access](https://www.spi-ind.com/OurForests/RecreationAccess). No trailering necessary!

_How far away is the river?_

_How does the electrical power work?_

Power comes from [PG&E](https://www.pge.com). A 7.5 KW solar array supplements this with the PG&E [net metering program](https://www.pge.com/en_US/residential/solar-and-vehicles/green-energy-incentives/solar-and-renewable-metering-and-billing/net-energy-metering-program-tracking/understand-net-energy-metering.page). In the event of a power outage, the solar array will automatically switch to stand-alone mode and generate electricity using the solar array or backup batteries, then switch back when power is restored.

_Where does the water come from?_

A spring on the lower section of the property feeds a storage tank, which is then pumped to the higher part of the property which gravity feeds the house. Two separate 2500 gallon tanks ensure there's a reserve capacity of water.
