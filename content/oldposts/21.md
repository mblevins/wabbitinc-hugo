I quit the old job today. Kind of painful since I like the team I’m working with, but sometimes you just have to move on. Things I obsess over: Books - I usually take about 5 books just to get to Europe and back, so I obsess on what I will do on the plane. The flight is twice as long, and I can’t take 10 books. I order a new video iPod and start looking for Audio books. Phone – I try and get a GSM phone so I can get a cheap India SIM card when I am there. But my provider (T-mobile) won’t unlock my phone for 90 days. So I buy a cheap unlocked GSM phone on e-bay. So far it works with my T-mobile chip from the new phone.
