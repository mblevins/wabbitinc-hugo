Finally was able to go to Delhi over the weekend and travel to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. Absolutely the most incredible man made structure I've ever seen, looks as just amazing from a mile away and 5 inches away. Two galleries here because we mixed cameras (which is a story itself, we lost one camera and one broke the viewfinder. Some of them are from a cheap disposable film camera) \[smugmug url="http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/hack/feed.mg?Type=gallery&Data=4705458\_dTEdr&format=rss200" imagecount="3" start="1" num="3" thumbsize="Ti" link="smugmug" captions="false" sort="true" window="false" smugmug="true" size="M"\]
