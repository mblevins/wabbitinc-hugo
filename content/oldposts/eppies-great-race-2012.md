This is a race report for the [2012 Eppie's Great Race](http://www.eppiesgreatrace.org/). I also have a [logistics report](http://02ccd16.netsolhost.com/wp1/?p=1202). Warning, this is pretty long winded. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150"\][![](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-63FB47q/0/Th/IMG3171-Th.jpg)](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-63FB47q/0/L/IMG3171-L.jpg) Before the race\[/caption\] After getting up at 4:30 and placing the kayak and bike, my crew and I (thanks Lola) got to the startup line around 7:20. That gave me enough time to walk to the park across the river, one last pee break and get to the starting line at 7:45. There were about 1000 runners, so it seemed a small race by Sacramento standards. I started at the 10:00m pace sign. At promptly 8:00 AM, we were off. My plan was to do the first mile around 10:15-10:30, then settle into a 10:00 pace to save myself for the bike. I looked at my Garmin at the first quarter mile, and we're doing about 12:00. With the combination of a slow group combined with my total inability to keep pace at the beginning of a race, I passed quite a few people on the outside of the path. The next time I looked at my pace, I was at 7:45. Oops. Time to stop passing people and settle into my 10:00 minute pace. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150"\][![](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-LNJrMbB/0/Th/100949-461-020f-Th.jpg)](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-LNJrMbB/0/L/100949-461-020f-L.jpg) Feelin' allright\[/caption\] I managed to slow down some, but still a little faster than I wanted. I slowed down a little each mile until I was at my planned 10:00 pace. I drank water at two of the stops - generally not something I would do in a 10k, but it was already in the mid-70's heading towards a 100+ day, and it was going to be a long race.

  Arrived at the bikes, and probably managed to do the slowest transition possible as I changed shoes, put my running shoes in my fanny pack, and took a leisurely drink. Headed out to the bike path path and started off. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150"\][![](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-bXLMW59/0/Th/100949-278-027f-Th.jpg)](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-bXLMW59/0/L/100949-278-027f-L.jpg) Ouch.\[/caption\] Intentionally went slow the first half mile, then decided to speed up a bit. People were passing me, but I managed to pass a few as well. It was much less crowded then I expected and the bike path was great. Things were going fine until... cramp. Cramp in my right calf. I could barely pedal. I think I passed 2 or 3 people after this point, where as probably 25-50 people must have passed me. I eventually got the cramp in my right leg under control, just in time for my left calf to cramp up. Tried all sorts things, but eventually settled on a low gear and regular pedal cadence. Even a moderately high gear and I'd cramp up again. Anyway, made it to the end of my bike run, and handed off my bike to a volunteer. Changed back to my running shoes, put my bike shoes in my fanny pack and ran (ok, hobbled) over the bridge to the kayaks.

  Found my kayak, took a swig of water and dragged the kayak to the water. I figured my lack of exertion on the bike (couldn't go fast because of the cramp) would give me a boost for the kayak. Not. I think this was my biggest surprise, how dead my arms were after the run and my (relatively) slow bike segment. \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150"\][![](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-4GhFdb9/0/Th/100949-237-009f-Th.jpg)](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-4GhFdb9/0/L/100949-237-009f-L.jpg) Man that paddle is heavy\[/caption\] Despite having taking a class specifically for the Eppie's Kayak course, I managed to screw my line up a couple of times by getting out of the current. It was a little challenging, because they were quite a few folks not exactly holding a line, and I was trying to avoid getting hit by them. Did get bumped once, but these were all plastic kayaks, no harm done. There was a huge range of kayak types - from river kayaks, cheap rec kayaks and a few sea kayaks. The racing kayaks were long gone by the time I got on the river. Finally at the point we were all waiting for: the San Juan Rapid. It is pretty tame by river standards, but it is still classified as a class II. There are two basic choices: (a) go slowly by the left bank, out of the current, or (b) go in the current, just to the left of the big rock in the river. However, I chose (c) - just to the right of the big rock ("say, isn't that rock supposed to be on the other side?"). Managed to keep it upright, but I swamped the cockpit. Fortunately I had on a half skirt that kept some of the water out. The woman to my left capsized. On the bright side, I passed a lot of people taking the safe route :) \[caption id="" align="alignright" width="150"\][![](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-GPLcV8T/0/Th/100949-505-027f-Th.jpg)](http://silverfiddle.smugmug.com/Family/eppierace2012/i-GPLcV8T/0/L/100949-505-027f-L.jpg) Stepin' it up a bit at the end\[/caption\] Pretty uneventful the rest of the race, but at some point I looked at my watch and saw I was getting close to my three hour goal. So I stepped the paddling up a bit, managed to cramp my arm, but kept on going.

Finished in 2:49:55, which was under my three hour goal. I was at 461/715 in the iron person's division (people who did all three segments themselves without a team), and 768/1075 including teams. What I would differently next time:

*   More training in general, but especially for the run-bike combo.
*   Slow down even more in the run - If I had been three minutes slower in the run, I think I could have minimized the cramps and pick up an easy 10 minutes in the bike.
*   More upper body work - I was surprised how dead my arms were for the kayak after the run/bike.
*   Double my hydration - I ran out of my electrolyte drink in both the bike and kayak.
*   Do a better job keeping my lines in the river - I was pretty sloppy.

Thanks again to Lola who crew'ed for me, there's no way I could have done this without her.
