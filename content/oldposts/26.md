I left San Jose about 6:45, and got to the Consulate around 8:15. I’m expecting something huge, like an embassy, but it is a small building between a pet shop and some residential homes. No problem parking at all. It opens at 9:00 AM, there are about 5 people in line. I wait in line for about ½ hour, then someone gives us a number and asks why we are there (Visa, passport, etc). It opens officially at 9:00 AM, and by 9:15 I’m out of there. I drive to Stonestown (because I know where it is) and hang out in a T-Mobile hotspot. We’re supposed to get the Visa’s any time after 4:00, but someone told me they have them early some times. So I get there at 3:00. There are probably 10 people in front of me. By the time 4:00 rolls around (it doesn’t open early), there are at least 50 people behind me. At least I’m out early. Pix taken with my camera phone
