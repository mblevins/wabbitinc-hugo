I decide to try Skype so I can do cheap calls from India to back home. I try and hook up my new Bluetooth headset to my PC. It doesn’t work with the Microsoft drivers, so I install some Widcom drivers. Now my Motorola phone tools won’t work over Bluetooth. Bluetooth feels like tcp-ip in the mid-80’s, you have to kind of know what you’re doing and it doesn’t work all at the same time. Everyone asks me if I know that it is flooding in Bangalore.
