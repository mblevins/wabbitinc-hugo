I try calling Lola with Skype using my USB headphones. It mostly works, but there's a definite delay. But at 1c a minute vs. $3.00 a minute, it seems worth it. The call breaks up towards the end and then gets better. Lola says the delay is like talking to someone who isn't paying attention, so it is must not be that different from talking to me when I'm in San Jose.
