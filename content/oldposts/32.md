Another day of work. See picture for a view of the traffic on the way to work.

The food is really good, haven't met a dish I haven't liked yet.

The lack of delay makes it seem like I'm actually paying attention. Everybody has these cool wireless mice with their laptops. But the office phone situation is not good, we have a phone conference with the US where we're passing around a headset mic. Seems wierd to be on the India end of a US phone conference for a change.
